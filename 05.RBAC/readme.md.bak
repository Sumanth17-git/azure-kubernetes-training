# 🔐 What is RBAC in Kubernetes?

**RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** controls **who can do what** within your Kubernetes cluster.

RBAC defines access based on:

- **Who** (subjects)  
- **Can do what** (verbs)  
- **On which resources**  
- **In what namespace**

This enables fine-grained access control over Kubernetes resources by assigning roles to users or groups and specifying their permissions within a namespace or cluster-wide.
