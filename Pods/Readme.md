# üì¶ Introduction to Kubernetes Objects and Pod YAML Structure

## üß† What are Kubernetes Objects?

Kubernetes **objects** are like instructions or blueprints that tell Kubernetes **how to manage your application and resources**. These objects define:

- ‚úÖ What to run (app, service, job, etc.)
- üì¶ How many copies should run
- üîó How it connects to other services
- üíæ How data is stored and persisted

> Think of Kubernetes objects as **declarative blueprints** that define your desired state.

---
## üß± Why Pods, Not Just Containers?

Kubernetes doesn't manage containers directly. Instead, it manages **Pods**, which are the **smallest deployable unit** in Kubernetes.

### üó≥Ô∏è What is a Pod?

A **Pod** is like a **box** that can hold one or more containers. It includes:
- Containers (e.g., NGINX, app, logger)
- Storage (volumes)
- Network configuration (IP, ports)

```bash
# Command to create a Pod manually
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx:latest
Example: A Pod might contain a web app container and a log forwarder sidecar container ‚Äî both working together.

## üß≠ Choosing the Right `apiVersion`

Different Kubernetes objects are managed under different **API groups**, and each uses a specific `apiVersion`.

This field tells Kubernetes which **versioned API** to use for validating and interpreting the object.

---

### üìò Common `apiVersion` Mappings

| üß© **Object Type**        | üî¢ **apiVersion Example** |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Pod, Service, ConfigMap   | `v1`                      |
| Deployment, StatefulSet   | `apps/v1`                 |
| Job, CronJob              | `batch/v1`                |

> ‚úÖ Tip: Always check your Kubernetes cluster version to ensure the object `apiVersion` is supported.

## üìå Fields Explained: Anatomy of a Kubernetes YAML File

Every Kubernetes YAML file follows a structured format. Let‚Äôs break down the **four core fields** used in almost all Kubernetes resource definitions.

---
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ `apiVersion`

The `apiVersion` field specifies **which version of the Kubernetes API** should be used to create and manage the object.

This helps Kubernetes determine:
- üõ†Ô∏è What features are supported
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Which validations apply
- üîÑ How to process the object

#### ‚úÖ Common Values:

| Kubernetes Object Type           | `apiVersion`   |
|----------------------------------|----------------|
| Pod, Service, ConfigMap          | `v1`           |
| Deployment, ReplicaSet, StatefulSet | `apps/v1`      |
| Job, CronJob                     | `batch/v1`     |

#### üß† Example:

```bash
apiVersion: apps/v1
```
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ `kind`

The `kind` field defines the **type of Kubernetes object** you are creating ‚Äî such as a `Pod`, `Service`, or `Deployment`.

This tells Kubernetes **what** the YAML file is intended to manage or deploy.

---

#### üß† Syntax Example:

```yaml
kind: Pod
```
#### üìò Common `kind` Examples

| Kubernetes Object Type | Description                                          |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `Pod`                  | A basic containerized unit                           |
| `Deployment`           | Scalable, self-healing application management        |
| `Service`              | Exposes your application to the network              |
| `ConfigMap`            | Stores non-sensitive configuration data              |


### 3Ô∏è‚É£ `metadata`

The `metadata` field contains identifying information about the Kubernetes object. This helps Kubernetes track, categorize, and manage the resource.
‚Ä¢	Contains details about the object, such as: 
o	name: Unique name of the object.
o	namespace: (Optional) Defines the namespace where the object will be created.
o	labels: Key-value pairs used for identification and selection.
o	annotations: Additional metadata (not used for selection).


#### üß† Example:

```yaml
metadata:
  name: my-nginx-pod
  namespace: default
  labels:
    app: nginx
    environment: dev
  annotations:
    description: "This is an NGINX pod"
    createdBy: "Admin"
```
#### üìã Metadata Field Breakdown

| Field        | Purpose                                                                |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`       | Unique name of the object within the namespace                         |
| `namespace`  | (Optional) Logical grouping; separates resources into environments     |
| `labels`     | Key-value pairs used for selection, grouping, and filtering            |
| `annotations`| Key-value pairs for attaching extra metadata (not used in selection)   |

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ `spec`

The `spec` (short for **specification**) defines the **desired state** of the Kubernetes object.

This is where you tell Kubernetes **what to do**, such as what containers to run, what ports to expose, how many replicas to maintain, or how to mount volumes.
‚úÖ How many replicas should run? (for Deployments)
‚úÖ What containers should run? (for Pods)
‚úÖ How should a Service expose an application?

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-nginx-pod
  namespace: default
  labels:
    app: nginx
    environment: dev
  annotations:
    description: "This is an Nginx pod"
    createdBy: "Admin"
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:latest
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80

```

üìå Explanation:
‚Ä¢	Creates a Pod named nginx-pod.
‚Ä¢	Runs a single container using the nginx image.
‚Ä¢	Opens port 80 inside the container.
