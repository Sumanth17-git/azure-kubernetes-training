# 🧊 Kubernetes Sidecar Containers: Real-Time Logging to Azure Log Analytics

## 🚀 What is a Sidecar Container?

A **sidecar container** is a helper container that runs **alongside the main application container** in the same Pod. It's commonly used to provide **supporting features** like logging, monitoring, proxying, or config reloads.

### 🔧 Key Characteristics:
- **Lifecycle-coupled**: Starts and stops with the main container.
- **Same network namespace**: Shares `localhost` and volumes with the main container.
- **Continuous service**: Often performs background work (log shipping, metrics scraping, etc.)
- **Supports probes**: Can have readiness/liveness probes like main containers.

## 📈 Real DevOps/SRE Use Case

> Imagine you're deploying **50 microservices**, and each service needs its logs sent to **Azure Log Analytics**.

Rather than installing one heavy log collector on each node, use a **lightweight Fluent Bit container as a sidecar per Pod**.

### 🧰 Toolset Used:
- **NGINX** as your sample application
- **Fluent Bit** as the sidecar container
- **Azure Log Analytics** for centralized log storage and filtering

## 🛠️ Implementation Steps

### ✅ Step 1: Create Log Analytics Workspace

```bash
az monitor log-analytics workspace create \
  --resource-group internal-training \
  --workspace-name aks-westus-logs \
  --location westus
```
### 🔑 Step 2: Get Workspace ID & Shared Key
###  Get Workspace ID
```bash
az monitor log-analytics workspace show \
  --resource-group internal-training \
  --workspace-name aks-westus-logs \
  --query customerId -o tsv
```

### Get Primary Shared Key
```bash
az monitor log-analytics workspace get-shared-keys \
  --resource-group internal-training \
  --workspace-name aks-westus-logs \
  --query primarySharedKey -o tsv
```
### 🔒 Step 3: Create Kubernetes Secret
Replace <workspace-id> and <shared-key> with actual output:
```bash
kubectl create secret generic log-analytics-secret \
  --namespace=default \
  --from-literal=workspace-id=da7cf587-ddb8-44b2-8951-0c5831239f53 \
  --from-literal=shared-key=m6sd6f1JIQhwQNCvPj9fn60AjOjSoU4C5ZPQq12FVikRMXELe3CcJY+MvKuqiSqesQndHW7AgOufTFFMEnJjSw==
```

### ⚙️ Step 4: Apply Fluent Bit Config and Microservices
Apply the Fluent Bit configuration (sidecar settings and input/output definitions):
```bash
kubectl apply -f fluent-bit-configmap.yaml
```
Deploy two microservices with NGINX + Fluent Bit sidecars:
```bash
kubectl apply -f microservice-a.yaml
kubectl apply -f microservice-b.yaml
```

### 🔍 Step 5: View Logs in Azure Log Analytics
After a few minutes, go to:
Azure Portal → Log Analytics Workspace → Logs and run:
```bash
nginxlogs
| where app_name_s == "microservice-a"
```
```bash
nginxlogs
| where app_name_s == "microservice-b"

```
This will allow you to filter logs by application, giving DevOps and SRE teams fine-grained observability.

## 🧠 Why the Sidecar Pattern used for Logging

The sidecar container model is particularly powerful when used for logging in modern DevOps and SRE environments.

| 🏆 **Benefit**                   | 📘 **Description**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🎯 **Granular Control**         | Logs are tied **per pod/service**, allowing precise filtering and analysis.     |
| 📦 **Lightweight & Decentralized** | Fluent Bit is tiny and doesn’t need to run as a **global DaemonSet**.           |
| 🛡️ **Fault Isolation**           | If the logging sidecar fails, it **doesn't affect the main app** container.     |
| 🔄 **Flexible Configuration**    | You can customize logging config **per environment** (dev, staging, prod).      |
| 🌐 **Cloud Native Integration**  | Seamlessly fits into **AKS, GKE, EKS**, and other Kubernetes-native platforms.   |
